# Calculator

[The Odin Project Fundamentals Final Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-calculator)

## How I coded it
Uses an array to store the expression and the buttons to add on numbers/operators to the array. It then uses a recursive function to follow PEMDAS until it reaches the base case of the array having 1 item left. Uses some regex generated from ChatGPT(very helpful in the sign/negative button to differentiate between subtraction and negative).
